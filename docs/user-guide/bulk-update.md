# Bulk Updates

## What is the need for Bulk Update?

It was an easy task to configure the `Deployment Template` of one or more applications, but the task becomes laborious to update the hundreds of applications. Here **Bulk Updates** comes into the picture.
This feature allows users to configure the `Deployment Template` of multiple applications at once. Users can do that by writing a script in this section.

There are two buttons at the topmost section:

* **Run**
* **Show Impacted Objects**
* **See Examples**

### 1. Run :

Write a valid script in the code editor section. Click on the `Run` button at the top. After clicking `Run` a bottom drawer with a selected `Output` section will open that is showing output.

## 2. Show Impacted Objects:

To see a list of all the names of the impacted applications. Click on the `Show Impacted Objects` button at the top. A bottom drawer with a selected `Impacted Objects` section will appear.

## 3.See Examples:
